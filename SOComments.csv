That is probably due to the 8-bit although in my experience the quantization error of 8-bit is usually not all that noticeable. It depends on how low RMS your original signal is. If 8-bit is necessary for some reason my advice is to use a higher bit depth and only quantize at the very end. Only quantizing at the end will minimize the error because it won't compound through intermediate operations. For the record that is probably what Audacity does. No serious audio application will do any DSP at the source bit depth."
