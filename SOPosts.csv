<p>Parsing logs is an old task, and there are many tools out there that are more than capable of doing this in an efficient way.</p>

<p>For me personally, I had success with <a href=""https://www.fluentd.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fluentd - Open Source Data Collector</a>, but there are more tools, depending on your specific needs.</p>

<p>The community, e.g, the amount, and quality of plugins/addons to the tool, is relevant when choosing the tool.</p>

<p>So if googling <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=fluntd+prometheus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fluentd prometheus</a> gets you some results from github and the developer itself - that might be your right course of action.</p>

  been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
  essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it?
  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
  content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
  have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
  from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
  classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
  very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32
  and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem
  Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
  hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
  model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

<p>This DOS function returns a <strong>character</strong> in <code>AL</code>. You should not store the whole of <code>AX</code> as your first number! What you need is:</p>

<pre><code>mov ah, 1

<p>It's fine to zero extend the dividend but think a moment about what <code>DIV AL</code> does. It will divide <code>AX</code> by <code>AL</code>.

<p>Wrap the <code>TabbedPage</code> in a <code>NavigationPage</code> so the structure of your app becomes</p>

<ul>
<li>NavigationPage (root)

<ul>
<li>TappedPage

<ul>
<li>NavigationPage 

<ul>
<li>ContentPage (with tabbar)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>ContentPage (without tabbar)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>On the TabbedPage you have to hide the navigationbar of the 'root' NavigationPage, otherwise you have 2 navbars.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabbedPage
    ...
    HasNavigationBar=""False""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If you push a page using the 'root' <code>NavigationPage</code>, the tabbar is hidden and there is no blank space at the bottom.</p>

<p>then if it says in the generated code <code>@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})</code> then it means you don't need to add the service to a providers array just start using it by injecting it into the constructor of your component as usual (recent Angular versions have providedIn root - if you don't have this then you will need to add your service to a providers array in the module in question).</p>

<p>Then in your component's ts file you can expose the entire service to the template by making the service public:</p>

<pre><code>constructor(public utilsService: UtilsService) {}

Inside my service provider in method <code>register</code> I first tried this:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;bind('url', MyCustomProvider::class);
</code></pre>

<p>This did register my URL provider instead of the default one. The problem was that <strong>now my provider didn't have any access to routes</strong>. I checked the Laravel code for <code>\Illuminate\Routing\RoutingServiceProvider</code> because it has a method <code>registerUrlGenerator</code> for registering the URL provider. This method did a direct instantiation of the Laravel URL generator <code>Illuminate\Routing\UrlGenerator</code> and giving proper parameters in the constructor.</p>

<p>So, I did the same in my service provider. Instead of doing <code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;bind</code> I did <code>$this-&gt;app-&gt;singleton('url', function ($app) { ... })</code> and provided basically the same code in the closure function as in <code>RoutingServiceProvider::registerUrlGenerator</code> but created the instance of my URL generator. This then worked properly, and my generator is now called every time. The final code was this:</p>

<pre><code>// the code is copied from the \Illuminate\Routing\RoutingServiceProvider::registerUrlGenerator() method
$this-&gt;app-&gt;singleton('url', function ($app) {
    /** @var \Illuminate\Foundation\Application $app */
    $routes = $app['router']-&gt;getRoutes();

    $app-&gt;instance('routes', $routes);

    // *** THIS IS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE ***
    $url = new \My\Specific\UrlGenerator(
        $routes,
        $app-&gt;rebinding(
            'request',
            static function ($app, $request) {
                $app['url']-&gt;setRequest($request);
            }
        ),
        $app['config']['app.asset_url']
    );

    $url-&gt;setSessionResolver(function () {
        return $this-&gt;app['session'] ?? null;
    });

    $url-&gt;setKeyResolver(function () {
        return $this-&gt;app-&gt;make('config')-&gt;get('app.key');
    });

    $app-&gt;rebinding('routes', static function ($app, $routes) {
        $app['url']-&gt;setRoutes($routes);
    });

    return $url;
});
</code></pre>

<p>I hate copying the code, so it seems to me that the problem is in the base implementation. It should take the correct contract for URL generator instead of making direct instantiation of a base class. </p>

<p>The reasoning for this is that my views are backed by strongly typed view models. Properties of C# models are pascal case. For the sake of model binding with MVC it makes sense that the names of HTML elements that bind to the model are consistent with the view model properties which are pascal case.

<p><code>EXPORT_SYMBOL()</code> makes <code>LogMessage()</code> is accessible to loadable kernel modules. </p>

<p>For eample, <code>vmalloc()</code> is exported to use in kernel modules <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/vmalloc.c#L1708"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/vmalloc.c#L1708</a></p>

<p>But still you have to include the <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/vmalloc.h#L67"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vmalloc.h</a> in loadable kernel module source.so do not confuse with extern and EXPORT_SYMBOL.   </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>In your Makefile, modify as below</p>

<pre><code>obj-m += ModemAPI.c StateMachine.c
</code></pre>

<p>i.e ModemAPI.c which has LogMessage() should be compiled first.  </p>

<p><strong>Change proposed to Makefile</strong></p>

<pre><code>obj-m += Mymodule.o

Mymodule-objs := ../Common/ModemAPI.o ../Common/StateMachine.o ../Common/ElementsPool.o

"20883688","4","","","0","2014-01-02 13:07:00","","558823","<p>The reason FParsec can't generate more useful error messages for your example is that you've defined the <code>ws</code> and <code>id</code> parsers using the <a href=""http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/charparsers.html#members.satisfy"" rel=""nofollow""><code>satisfy</code></a> primitive. Since you only specified a predicate function, FParsec doesn't know how to describe the expected input. The <a href=""http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/users-guide/customizing-error-messages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">User's Guide</a> explains this issues and how to avoid it. In your code, you could e.g. use <code>satisfyL</code> or <a href=""http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/reference/charparsers.html#members.many1SatisfyL"" rel=""nofollow""><code>many1SatisfyL</code></a> for the definitions.</p>

<p>After fixing the <code>ws</code> and <code>id</code> parsers you'll quickly discover that your code doesn't properly parse the list because the whitespace parsing is messed up. Where possible, you should always parse whitespace as trailing whitespace, not as leading whitespace, because this avoids the need for backtracking. To fix your parser for the input you gave above, you could e.g. replace </p>

<pre><code>sepEndBy1 (ws &gt;&gt;. whereCondition) (newline)
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>sepEndBy1 (whereCondition .&gt;&gt; ws) (newline &gt;&gt;. ws)
</code></pre>

<p>in the definition of <code>multiConditionWhereList</code>. </p>

<p>Note that a non-empty error message list doesn't necessarily imply an error, as FParsec will generally collect the error messages of all parsers that were applied at the current position in the stream, even if the parser is ""optional"". This is probably the reason you were seeing the ""expected newline"", since a newline would have been accepted at that position.</p>

  <p>How can I use G-mail or some other mail client to deliver a new e-mail to a new recipient along with an intended message body based upon a subset of the original message with delivery instructions? Both the intended recipient and new message would be specified somewhere inside the original message body.</p>

<p>If this is what you are suggesting, I believe you would be asking for trouble even considering this.

<p>You want the previous call for each phone number, so you need to partition by <code>phone_no</code>, and order by <code>call_date</code>. This shows the previous value for all three fields:</p>

<pre><code>select phone_no, call_id, call_date,
  lag(phone_no) over (partition by phone_no order by call_date)
    as prev_phone_no,
  lag(call_id) over (partition by phone_no order by call_date)

In order for this to behave like a truly fixed bottom bar, in mobile Safari it is necessary to use <code>position: fixed</code> on the content above it (with <code>bottom</code> set to the height of the bottom bar) and also set <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code> on this content in order for it to scroll as if it weren't fixed.</p>

<p>The problem is that if Safari's bottom bar is hidden and then you try to click on our app's bottom bar, this will make Safari's own bottom bar appear, but without triggering a resize event which will effectively hide our app's bottom bar even though it has <code>position: fixed</code>. Safari's bottom bar normally goes away once you scroll the content, except that our content has <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;</code> set, so it apparently doesn't trigger UI hiding.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to either prevent Safari's bottom bar from popping up when clicking at the bottom of the page, or being able to hide the UI when scrolling, even if the content that is scrolled has <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;</code> set. Thanks.</p>

You can reference <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/origineil/8SKbk/"" rel=""nofollow"">my example</a> for this setup. Essentially, each required property is mapped to observables. Changes made to the value of any observable property triggers (via a <code>subscription</code>) a mutation call for a dummy observable that is used in a <code>computed</code>. This is required since a computed can't call <code>valueHasMutated</code>. The mutation call triggers the computed to reevaluate, thus updating the UI.</p></li>

<p>LiveCam -> filter1 = FilteredOp1</p>

<p>LiveCam -> filter2 = FilteredOp2</p>

<p>FilteredOp1 + FilteredOp2 --> on real device screen</p>

<p>so basically i want to process camera in two filters and whatever is the output should be given to camera
initially i thout <strong>GPUImageFilterGroup</strong> would help but after some experiments i realised its for chaining and not mixing.i saw some code where people are blending saved video with live cam but thats not what i want</p>

<ol>
<li>Use change isntead of input event. input event is great, but does not apply to input[type=file].</li>
<li>You should not override checkValidity</li>
<li>Use setCustomValidity on dom ready + every change</li>
<li>use reportValidity, if available, to report errors or mimic reportValditity by clicking on a submit button</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a simple method to make setCustomValidity simpler:</p>

<pre><code>//setCustomValidity is stupid so we improve by adding setCustomValidityRule
$.fn.setCustomValidityRule = function (type, rule) {
    var testRule = function () {
        //only if it's valid or we have set the message our own
        if ($(this).is(':valid') || $.data(this, 'customErrorType' + type)) {
            var message = rule(this);
            this.setCustomValidity(message);
            if (message) {
                $.data(this, 'customErrorType' + type, message)
            } else {
                $.removeData(this, 'customErrorType' + type);
            }
        }
    };
    return this
    //invoke initially
    .each(testRule)
    //and on every change
    .on('customchange.customerror' + type + ' change.customerror' + type, testRule);
};
</code></pre>

<p>And here is a method to make reportValidity work in current browsers:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.reportValidity = function () {
    return this.each(function () {
        var form;
        if (this.reportValidity) {
            this.reportValidity();
        } else {
            form = $($.prop(this, 'form')).add(this).filter('form');
            //checkvalidity is obtrusive sometimes so we use :invalid
            if($(':invalid', form).length){
            $('&lt;input type=""submit"" /&gt;')
                .css({
                    position: 'absolute',
                    left: '-99999px'
                })
                .appendTo(form)
                .click()
                .remove();
            }
        }
    });
};
